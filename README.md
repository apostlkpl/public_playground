# Public Playground

This is my public repository for Jupyter Notebooks.
All code is MIT lisenced, feel free to use.

> Warning: Code might be messy.

Most Jupyter files assume the libraries on the requirements text file are already installed. If not sure, download the txt file and while in the current folder run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Creating a new Virtual Environment is highly recommended before running any code, but is not strictly necessary, especially on Windows.
```
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name> # Create a new environment
source <virtual-environment-name>/bin/activate     # Activate the environment
deactivate                                         # Deactivate the environment
```

A venv is required on current Ubuntu/Debian installations, according to Proposal 668:
